## Features

### Giveaway System with or without wallet connection

Create giveaways within your Discord, allowing the user to participate only by reacting and/or also allowing the user to connect their wallet so that the delivery of the prize is simplified.

### Create forms for various cases

With the form creation tool, you are free to create different types of questions, and then you can export the answers for future conference.

We currently offer the following different question types:

- Multiple choice
- Checkbox-style
- Freeform
- Numbers-only
- Date-only

Form templates can be exported from an already created form and imported to create another one on the same or another server, thus facilitating the process of building the form with templates.
